# Tasks and Changes

## Initial Setup

- Explored the project structure
- Created tasks.md file to document changes
- Successfully started the development server with `npm run dev`

## Project Analysis

- This is a Next.js application that generates social media content
- The app uses OpenAI and Supabase based on package.json
- The main page (page.tsx) contains a UI for generating content for various social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn)
- The application appears to analyze a website and generate platform-specific content strategies

### API Structure

- `api/check-api-status`: Endpoint to verify OpenAI API connection
- `api/generate-content`: Endpoint that takes a URL and generates social media content ideas
- `api/generate-trends`: Endpoint that generates AI trend-related content

## Development Server Status

- Development server is running successfully in the background
- The app is now accessible at http://localhost:3000 (verified with curl)
- API endpoints are responding correctly

## Environment Requirements

- The application requires an OpenAI API key to function properly
- The OpenAI key should be set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Created a `.env.local` file with a placeholder for the OpenAI API key
  ```
  # OpenAI API Key - Required for generating content
  # Replace with your actual API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  ```
- The user needs to replace this placeholder with their actual OpenAI API key

## Changes Made

### API Fixes

- Fixed API connection issue by updating the OpenAI API calls in all three API routes:
  - Updated model name from `gpt-4.1` to `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`
  - Updated API call format from `openai.responses.create()` to `openai.chat.completions.create()`
  - Updated response parsing from `response.text` to `response.choices[0].message.content`
  - Added proper type checking for error handling
- Created a `.env.local` file with a placeholder for the OpenAI API key

### Content Generation Enhancements

- Significantly improved content generation by:
  - Increasing max_tokens from 8000 to 32000 for generate-content API (4x original)
  - Increasing max_tokens from 4000 to 32000 for generate-trends API (8x original)
  - Ensuring each platform (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) has exactly 6 detailed ideas
  - Adding extensive detail requirements for each idea including comprehensive shot lists and technical specifications
  - Increasing the API request duration limit from 120s to 600s to allow for much more detailed content generation
  - Adding explicit breakdown requirements to guarantee exactly 6 ideas per platform
  - Emphasizing the critical nature of providing exactly 6 ideas with maximum detail
- Integrated search functionality to get latest trends:
  - Added new API calls to search for trending content specific to the website's industry
  - Added search for trending music for Instagram/TikTok content
  - Added search for latest AI trends relevant to the company's industry
  - Incorporated trending information into the prompt context for more relevant content
  - Added detailed research on AI applications in social media content creation
- Enhanced prompt engineering for better results:
  - Added more precise instructions for content detail and length
  - Improved prompt structure to guarantee exactly 6 ideas per platform
  - Added more comprehensive JSON schema with additional fields and stats
  - Added design detail requirements including technical specifications and shot lists
  - Required multiple paragraphs of detail for each section

### UI Improvements

#### First Dropdown Animation Fix

- Improved dropdown animation from the Customize button to make it smoother
- Added a subtle scale effect (0.98 to 1) for a more natural opening/closing
- Switched to spring animation with proper stiffness and damping
- Increased animation duration to make it less abrupt
- Added more vertical movement for a clearer animation
- Added rounded corners with `rounded-xl` instead of square edges
- Added proper shadow with `shadow-md` for depth
- Added margin between search bar and dropdown
- Increased padding inside the dropdown
- Added z-index to ensure dropdown stays above other elements
- Rounded the input fields and textarea
- Added hover states to form sections

#### Further UI Enhancements

- Renamed application from "Content Studio" to "Better Captions"
- Added more space below the input container when dropdown is open with `pb-96` class
- Used subtle gradient backgrounds with `bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-50 to-white`
- Improved dropdown animation with slower, more fluid transitions:
  - Reduced spring stiffness from 100 to 70 for a gentler motion
  - Increased animation duration from 0.4s to 0.5s
  - Smoother opacity transition (0.3s)
- Added backdrop blur effect with `backdrop-blur-sm bg-white/95`
- Increased shadow from `shadow-md` to `shadow-lg` for better depth
- Changed input focus states to use blue accents (more on-brand)
- Increased overall spacing and padding throughout the form
- Added visual feedback to the Customize button with `bg-blue-50` when active
- Updated header from "ShopOS" to "Better Captions" for consistent branding

## Summary

- The application is a social media content generation tool built with Next.js
- It uses OpenAI's API to analyze websites and generate platform-specific content ideas
- The development server is running successfully and the application is accessible at http://localhost:3000
- We fixed API connection issues by updating to the latest OpenAI API format and model name
- We improved content generation quality by increasing token limits and enhancing prompts
- We added search functionality to incorporate trending content and music
- We significantly improved the UI with smoother animations and better visual design
- For full functionality, an OpenAI API key needs to be added to the `.env.local` file
- The app can generate content for Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn

## Usage Instructions

1. Edit the `.env.local` file to add your OpenAI API key
2. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
3. Enter a website URL to analyze
4. The application will analyze the website and generate content ideas for different social media platforms
5. You can view and copy the generated content for each platform

## Next Steps

If needed, additional improvements could include:

- Adding error handling for missing API keys with better user feedback
- Implementing caching to reduce API calls
- Adding rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage
- Expanding the UI to support more social media platforms
